# EE283 Final Project

As I am not too familiar with python, I chose to write a python program that reads an input vcf file (generated from the 
DNAseq pipeline built and used in this repository) and:
	i.  Calculate the frequency of the "ALT" allele for each position & sample
	ii. Output frequency and coverage for each sample
  
 To do this, I need to accomplish the following:
 -iterate over each variant position in the vcf file
  -for each variant, iterate over every sample to collect "ALT" allele frequency
