# EE283 Final Project

As I am not too familiar with python, I chose to write a python program that reads an input vcf file (generated from the 
DNAseq pipeline built and used in this repository) and:
	i.  Calculate the frequency of the "ALT" allele for each position & sample
	ii. Output frequency and coverage for each sample
  
 To do this, I need to accomplish the following:
 -generate individual sample vcf files using the same variant calling scripts, as all samples are merged in the previously made vcf
 -
